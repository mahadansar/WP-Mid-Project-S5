			<p>Tech Specialist & Marketing Manager</p>

			<p>I am working at WST since 2005. Its a place which uses cutting edge technology and we are looking further into the future and hope to pull it for us instead of the past pushing us behind it. Once I took down 3 people with a pencil in a bar.</p>

		<p>The Dedicated Development Team model is a great fit for businesses who need to quickly ramp up their development resources or augment their internal development teams with rare or highly specialized talent.</p>
		<p>The dedicated team approach can benefit your business in many ways, allowing you to rapidly scale up or down as needed, cut the development costs, and reduce time to market.</p>
		<p>All while retaining complete control over the project vision, milestones, and deliverables.</p>
